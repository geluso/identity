# The Infinite Assassin
One thing never changes: when some mutant junkie on S
starts shuffling reality, it's always me they send into
the whirlpool.

they tell me I'm exactly the same person as when 'I' went in.

there's a drug called S that's highly illegal.
taking the drug shuffles reality
there are an infinite number of universes
each one has
  * the S drug
  * a company dedicating itself to controlling this thing
  * ghettos where people live without cops

the character is warned there's a group planning to interfere
with his mission.

the character does not fear the "insignificant" threat posed by such a threat.
such threats normally aren't consistent when reality shuffles. such a group in
one reality probably won't exist in the next reality.

he has no doubt they __have__ killed versions of himself in the past and he
doesn't want it to be himself this time. the only difference between himself
being killed and others would be that they survived

he's still troubled about the thought of his own death

shuffling through different realities moves the assassin through realities with
different histories. fashion and changes in style are the most visible
indicator that things are changing.

he bumps into someone coming out of a bar. he doesn't respond. he just let's
the guy say something until he's out of air. he wonders how many of his other
selves didn't get away with the situation so easily.

The nature of S
* S users dream
* they're dreams of what the users life might literally have been
* the user can abandon living one life and choose another if they find they
  don't like it
* S lets the dreamer live vicariously in that parallel world
* they are literally connected to someone else that has similar physiologolly
* the mechanics of the drug don't matter, I believe. there's a larger story

sometimes, one in a hundred throusand, S users start to physically move
from reality to reality

usually this cancels out. nothing really happens. no one really notices. 
but every now and then. there's a big storm. they call it a whirlpool.
instead of just the user being swept into and popped over to the other reality
they take part of their own reality with them. the closer you are the more
likely you're to be caught up and dragged along in the whirlpool.

the assassin's job is to jump into the heart of the whirpool and phase from
reality to reality along with the dreamer until they get close enough to them
and can kill them and end the storm.

an aside:
  the world at large has about zero-tolerance for the S drug
  anyone caught with the S drug is immediately shot to death
  the world at large does not expose itself to the risk of having their
  stable realities torn apart by whirpools, no matter how rare they are

  the people that take the drug and the rare times that the S drug whirpools
  occur always happen in ghettos without drug enforcement. people can get away
  with taking the drug and no one cares. it's not until that one one in
  a hundred thousand chance happens that stuff gets really messed up.

  it is the assassin's job to be sent in to the whirpools when they happen and
  kill the user so the whirpool doesn't spread out across into the rest of the
  world.

cool technology:
  the assassin has a pair of binoculors that detect how many changes are
  happening in a picture frame

  it's described as detecting changes like
  * an item of clothing changing
  * a person suddently shifting position
  * or vanishing, or materallizing from nowhere

  it says the binoculors count up the number of events happening and map them
  on to map coordinate positions

  in this way the assassin can look around and see the source of the S user
  dreaming by looking to see where more events occur. more events occur
  always nearer the dreamer

  the author points out that the rate of change and proximity is so far far
  away enough from the dreamer that anyone near each other on the same block
  won't notice any changes because they'll all shift through realities
  together. it won't become visible until you're much closer to the dreamer and
  see other people's shirts changing, or restaurant signs changing right in
  front of you.

the assassin is met by a woman
the woman says she knows what is happening and can help the assassin find the
dreamer. the assassin is suspicious. the assassin asks why she would help.
she says she has a business here. she doesn't want to lose all the work she's
done building up contacts and community.

she has a good line about why she doesn't just leave

"do you think I care if the government changes, or the pop starts have
different names? the outside world doesn't matter to me. this is my home. if
Leightown shifts, I'm better off shifting with it. or with part of it."

the assassin talks about the mathematical weights and measurements of his
individual actions carried out by his multiple selves across the infinity of
realities.

the assassin has a good line:

"As for worrying about those alter egos who desert, or fail, or die, there’s
a simple solution: I disown them. It’s up to me to define my identity any way
I like. I may be forced to accept my multiplicity, but the borders are mine to
draw. ‘I’ am those who survive, and succeed. The rest are someone else."

ending at 7/12

The assassin uses his binoculars to look over the city and measure the rates of
changes everywhere. He sees people flickering in and out of existence. There's
one man on a street corner who remains consistent, but his hairstyle changes
five times. The binoculars measure all the changes and compute the estimated
center of the whirpool. It's a house near where the stranger woman pointed out
to the assassin before. He continues toward the building refusing to act on his
knowledge of the tip because he can't assume all his other selves received the
same tip.

The assassin leaves the hill and enters the heart of the city, getting closer
and closer to the center of the whirpool. Changes around him accelerate wildly.

The changes occur so rapidly the closer he gets to the center of the whirpool
buildings don't keep a consistent form. Buildings become an amalgamation of
different structures and styles. Many buildings can't account for the
structural inconsistencies and topples in on themselves.

The street is full of abandoned cars. Debris gets in the assassin's way. He
says it is easier to wait for obstructions to flicker out than to try to get
around them.

The assassin delves further into the center of the whirpool and looks back.
The assassin is shifting so rapidly that the buildings outside become a smear.

The assasin reaches a building which he determines clearly contains the
whirlpool-causing dreamer. The building oscillates between three entrances.  He
and the company have pre-determined to favor choosing the left-most entrance
always. This helps keep himself and his infinite counterparts in sync with each
other. Making the same choice makes sure the inifinite assassins maintain
a cohesive whole across all these infinite realities and don't diverge into
random nothingness.

The assassin plants a bomb and the bomb disappears. The bomb shifts into
another of the inifinite realities. Though this bomb disappears the assassin
trusts the infinite other assassins to have placed their bomb and trusts the
bombs all together will destroy the building.

The assassin runs outside the building to take cover from the bomb. A doorway
flickers out of existence and becomes a wall. The assassin takes a step back.
A moment later another doorway flickers into existence and the assassin steps
through.

The bomb doesn't go off. Somehow something went wrong in all infinite universes
and things don't add up. The assassin goes back to plant another bomb. Again,
the bomb doesn't go off. Something is wrong. All infinite assassins should
be doing the same thing and the sum of all their actions should be consistent.
Why is the bomb not going off?

The assassin enters the building and combs room by room floor by floor to find
the dreamer to kill them and end the whirpool of realities. The assassin
follows a strategy to try to keep themselves in sync with the rest of their
infinite selves. The assassin searches each room on each floor and waits for
minutes to reach round 10 before they move on to search the next floor. They
only move on to the next floor at time increments of ten, twenty, thirty,
fourty, fifty minutes and on the hour. This strategy should keep them in sync.

The assassin finds the room with the sleeper sleeping dreaming. They walk up to
the dreaming sleeping sleeper point their gun to their head and pull the
trigger. The bullet shifts to another reality before it hits the target.
According to the plan and the care taken for careful synchronization another
bullet from another reality should have phased in to this reality and reached
the target. No bullet ever arrives. Shot after shot the bullets never reach
their target.

The stranger is in the room. The stranger explains there's an infinite infinite
infinite infinite number of possibilities. (Something strange, I don't let
myself get bogged down in this author's math stuff.)

The stranger explains there's somewhere where the dreamer always wins. there's
somewhere where the assassin always wins.

It ends: 

"""
  in how many infinite sets of worlds will I take one more step? And how many
  countless versions of me will turn around instead, and walk out of this room?
  Who exactly am I saving from shame, when I’ll live and die in every possible
  way?

  Myself.
